# Flick Peek

Responsive movie exploration app created with React.

# NOTES:
### Create-React-App Next
This app currently uses the `next` version of `create-ract-app` (equivalent to version 5 alpha), because version 4 of CRA cannot currently (November 2021) handle ESM dependencies properly. Update the CRA version to a stable one when one becomes available!
